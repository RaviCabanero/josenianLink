# Admin User Implementation - JosenianLink

## Overview
The admin authentication system has been successfully implemented to provide admin users with special access to the admin dashboard.

## Admin User Configuration

### Admin Email Addresses
The following email addresses are configured as admin accounts:
- `admin@josenianlink.com`
- `administrator@josenianlink.com`  
- `admin@usjr.edu.ph`

## How it Works

### 1. Admin Login Process
When a user logs in using one of the admin email addresses:
- âœ… System checks if the email is in the admin list
- âœ… If admin: redirects to `/admin` page with admin dashboard
- âœ… If regular user: redirects to `/home` page
- âœ… Shows appropriate welcome message for each user type

### 2. Admin Guard Protection
- âœ… Admin routes are protected by `AdminGuard`
- âœ… Only admin users can access `/admin` route
- âœ… Regular users trying to access admin routes are redirected to home
- âœ… Unauthenticated users are redirected to login

### 3. User Profile Display
- âœ… Home page displays user's full name from registration
- âœ… Admin users see "Administrator" as their display name
- âœ… Regular users see their registered full name

## Testing the Admin Functionality

### To test admin login:
1. **Register a new admin account:**
   - Use one of the admin emails (e.g., `admin@josenianlink.com`)
   - Complete registration process
   - System will recognize this as an admin email

2. **Login with admin credentials:**
   - Use the admin email and password
   - You will be redirected to the admin dashboard
   - You'll see "Welcome Administrator!" message

3. **Login with regular user:**
   - Use any other email address
   - You will be redirected to the home page
   - You'll see your registered full name

### Admin Dashboard Features:
- âœ… Employee management (view, add, edit employees)
- âœ… Profile management
- âœ… Quick navigation to other sections
- âœ… Admin-specific welcome message
- âœ… Logout functionality
